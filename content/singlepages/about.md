## Beginnings
Eric started playing piano at the age of 5 and hasn't stopped since. His grandmother, an accomplished concert pianist, was his first teacher. In his teens, Eric played piano for his home church, accompanied a semi-professional choir, and placed in numerous classical competitions. He received a large scholarship to attend California Baptist University at the age of 16, and was the main accompanist for their performing groups while studying.

## Freelancing
After college, Eric quickly found work in the Los Angeles area. He played for musical theater auditions, music-directed shows, accompanied multiple choirs, and did contract work for local composers. Notable accomplishments include accompanying singers at the Hollywood Bowl and on national TV. During this time, he also arranged and recorded a CD of hymn arrangements for piano.

## Professional Life
Eric found his way to Houston in 2014 and took a position at Houstons First Baptist Church. He ran their School Of Fine Arts, which included over 120 students and 15 teachers. He also accompanied the 200-strong choir and orchestra, music directed the band, and helped arrange numerous choral works for publishing. In 2016, he transitioned to a role in music production, which included orchestrating, contracting musicians, programming tracks, running live stems, tuning vocals, editing musical charts, and more. He has continued to freelance on the side, continuously adding to his stack of skills.
